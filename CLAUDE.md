If Overtone doesn't start, look for this error:

    ERROR: Input sample rate is 16000, but output is 44100. Mismatched sample rates are not supported. To disable input, set the number of input channels to 0.

It's an annoying Supercollider thing that happens when the microphone and speakers aren't using the same bitrate.
